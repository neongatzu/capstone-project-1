                <h3>About me</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and I'm looking for something that will expand
                    my knowledge in the area.
                    I'm highly motivated and I think it's important to constantly learn new things, so in addition to everything I did
                    during my degree, I also explored different technologies, such as Unity and Blender.
                    I'm very organized and focused in my work, always trying to make a difference with what I do.</p>
